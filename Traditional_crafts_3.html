            <h2>Philippines Traditional Arts and Crafts</h2>
            <p>The Philippines The arts and crafts of the Philippines have been around for many thousands of years with jade carvings being one of the earliest examples that dates back to around 2000 BC. While many of the indigenous <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> like pottery and weaving, are still in use and flourish other crafts, such as the wood carving of a religious nature that I witnessed in Pampanga are relatively newcomers brought in by people who came from different provinces.
            The Philippines numerous artistic as well as <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> are not just to its unique melting pot of cultures as well as the wealth of natural materials readily accessible, including bamboo, rattan, or coconut shells, just to name just a few.</p>
            <ul>

                  It is the Oyster is a Windowpane

              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>The craft industry is also benefiting from the abundance of the ocean. Capiz for instance, is originated by the shells of Placuna placenta mollusk that is abundant in Philippine waters. These edible mollusks are taken to eat and the shells are utilized for <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> for fishermen. The waste is never wasted!
            Capiz is a fragile transparent and iridescent in nature. Spanish colonists in the Philippines made use of capiz shells in order to create <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that included stained windows made of glass for their churches during the 16th century. This earned the mollusk the name "windowpane oyster." Capiz lampshades made of shells hanging from trees in gardens and parks are now quite commonplace. I couldn't resist purchasing one in the airport prior to taking off for home to use it as an ornament to decorate my tree for Christmas. It's a wonderful way to remember my time in the city.</p>

              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>While certain <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> are common throughout the Philippines However, there are some that are exclusive to certain ethnic groups. Traditional costumes and textiles are notable in particular.
            Dream Weavers are women from T'boli living in the southern part of the archipelago close to Lake Sebu in the province of South Cotabato. They weave T'nalak which is hand-woven cloth made from fibers from the indigenous plant Abaca. The textile, and the women who weave it, are adored. The designs they weave weren't invented by women or their predecessors. Fu Dalu, the spirit of the Abaca design, introduced the patterns to them through their visions, and they were reconstructed completely by memory.
            Indonesian Arts and Crafts
            Beadwork, jewelry, batik pottery wooden carving stone carving, leather puppets and painting are but some of the instances from Indonesian <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> as well as arts. If you're looking through the market stalls or hunting for that perfect item take note that these items were designed with local artisans who utilized their vast skills to make these pieces. Every leather puppet or any carving on wood every beautiful batik is an original work of art that pays tribute to the history of Indonesia.</p>

                <h3>
                  Carvings in Wood
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>The shop that we went was filled with small and huge pieces. Decorations of gods like Buddha or Ganesh and masks were among the small things. Tableaux, walls and columns are adorned with <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> made of carvings that decorate the doors and walls.
            The remains of the deceased or gifts for the religious are stored in wooden urns or other beautiful receivers. The largest pieces were authentic furniture, some of which were found in restaurants and homes of the local area as well as an indication that carving wood is an important part of everyone in the Balinese. A bigger piece according to the owner of the workshop, would take anywhere from four to six months to make showing true passion for the arts.
            Ebony, crocodile, (found exclusively in Bali) and hibiscus sandalwood (from Flores Island), and mahogany are the most important elements of wood. The abilities of the sculptors are remarkable using metal tools, their sharp carving tools, carefully removing wood chips, and turning an unfinished wood log into an art.
            Villages like Tegalalang, Singakerta, Pujung, Jati, Pengosekan, Celuk and Mas are the home of many of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that the woodcarvers of Bali. Kubu Taman Sari from Batusepih, Kemenuh - Sukawati was the place we visited.</p>
            <ul>

                <h3>
                  Puppets made from leather
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>The small store, hidden behind the road, was hiding the amazing work that was done. In the case of leather, there's only stitching. The first worker started by cutting the skin of the leather by using pinching tools to create the design and pattern of the figurine. The buffalo hide makes the ideal skin to make puppets. It is one of the <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> with leather and cow skin can also be utilized often.
            A tiny object could require only a couple of days of careful work, whereas a larger doll may take several weeks. The majority of puppets range between 10 and thirty inches (25 and 75 centimeters) tall. A different artist painted the cut parts using the natural yellow skin color to create a backdrop or painting it black or white according to the type of the figure in <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a>. Every part in the character is then painted the same way, which requires weeks of work since each side has to dry before proceeding to the next. The apparatus that creates the puppets is constructed of natural elements like soft wood and even plants. In Bali the art of puppetry is called Wayang kulit that means "shadow puppetry." It is believed to be one of the oldest known puppet form that dates up to either the 9th or 8th centuries.</p>

                  Batik
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>The workshop we attended was very informative and enjoyable. Two different batik techniques were demonstrated in a tiny space. The hot wax can be utilized to create <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> lines and dots. An alternative is to employ the hot copper stamp for printing the pattern. Batiks printed with a printer are generally cheaper because they can be produced quicker.
            The heavy stamps were generally used by men who coated them with wax before pressing them onto the fabric to make them impregnate the fabric. Drawing with a pencil became the sole activity of women who carefully created lines and dots on large swaths of white or colored fabrics.
            While they dipped their brushes into the hot wax prior to drawing, the unhindered flow of their fingers was as if they were dancing. The women created a circle around the boiling pots waiting to be dipped in. A line of clothes dried in shade after the workshop had contaminated it with natural colors. In particular, people from the Balinese are influenced by and wear <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that are not only intended for tourists. The position of the bearer, particular locations, or traditional occasions like weddings, can be identified through designs. We visited Batik Plentong on Jl. Tirtodipuran 48 in Yogyakarta.</p>

            <p>Although we didn't visit the stone carving workshop however, the stunning beauty of the <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> of carving walls that we saw in various temples was not to be missed. The designs for the junctions showed an impressive degree of craftsmanship, featuring scenes that reflected mythology and history which were extremely precise and precise.
            Stone narrative can be seen in temples, such as those of Hindu Pura Besakih. Local artisans are fixing damaged artifacts, their skills and knowledge are evident in many places, such as Prambanan Temple.
