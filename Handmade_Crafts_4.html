            </ul>	
             <p>In the beginning of the 1700s, the majority of us ate and drank from wooden plates and bowls except for an occasional change to pottery due to the Romans. Each town had a local wood-turner, who employed an elastic sapling that was fastened at the bottom for his pole lathe which was a <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> piece of wood posts and beams. A cord is hung from the sapling's free end after which it is tucked around a chuck spiked and that is hammered into the block of wood that you're turning. The chuck spins when you press down the treadle of a foot that is attached to the cord's other end. If you let go of your treadle, it rotates back around. A chisel, or hook tool makes the wood stronger with every downward stroke. It's an extremely skilled task which is also very satisfying.</p>

            </ul>	
             <p>In the 1950s, wet baskets were used to transport food, laundry as well as coal, fruit and shopping carts and even mail were the norm in British life. The weaving of baskets hasn't changed much in the past tens of thousands of years. Knives are employed to lift the ends of willow rods and cut the basket's finished form; a bodkin is employed to create holes in the weaving. The cleave and shave are used to cut rods into four or three finer skeins, and beaters are used to break the weave. The base is built initially by constructing a round or rectangular frame that is made up of stakes that are stronger and interspersed with finer rods of willow. The stakes that are upright from <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> are then inserted into the side frame. Then it is then laid the initial weave. The stakes for the upright are then put in to build the side frame. The beginning weaves are laid. You then begin weaving using one of the many types, such as rending, fetching, slewing, and weaving. End with a top-to-bottom border. A strong hand, and sense of straight lines and lots of patience are needed.</p>

                        Stone walling that is dry

                </li>
            </ul>	
             <p>It is estimated that there are 15,000 miles of stone walls that are dry in the United Kingdom. A few of them are very old, dating back to the year 3,500 BC. Most of them are field walls that were built in the 1890s, as a result of the Enclosure Acts. They were maintained well for over 100 years, but agriculture today isn't able to support the infrastructure. Dry stone walls are making an appearance again. It's like putting together a 3D Jigsaw puzzle to make <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a>. The foundation stones that are massive as well as heavy are placed in a trench that is shallow, then followed by huge flat stones, and finally, caps that are straight. The only instrument you will need is a hammer, with sharp edges. However, the best Wallers stay clear of cutting stone into shapes the most perfect shape.
