            <h2>Philippines Traditional Arts and Crafts</h2>
            <p>The Philippines The arts and crafts of the Philippines are a long-standing tradition dating back to many thousands of years jade carving is one of the earliest examples dating back around 2200 BC. While many of the indigenous <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> like pottery and weaving are still in use and flourish other crafts, such as the wood carving of a religious nature that I witnessed in Pampanga are relatively newcomers brought by people who came from different provinces.
            The Philippines numerous art as well as <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> are not just to its unique melting pot of cultures but also due to the abundance of natural resources readily accessible, like bamboo, rattan, or coconut shells to mention some.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>
                  This is an Oyster is a Windowpane. Windowpane
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>The craft industry is also benefiting from the abundance of the ocean. Capiz for instance, is originated in the shell of the Placuna placenta mollusk which is abundant in Philippine waters. These edible mollusks are taken to eat and the shells are utilized for <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> used by fisherman. There is no waste!
            Capiz is a fragile transparent, transparent, and iridescent in nature. Spanish people living in the Philippines utilized capiz shells for the production of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that included stained windows made of glass for their churches during the 16th century. This earned the mollusk the name "windowpane oyster." Capiz lamp shades made of shells suspended from trees in gardens and parks are becoming more commonplace. I couldn't resist purchasing one in the airport prior to taking off for home to use it as an ornament to decorate my tree for Christmas. It's a wonderful way to remember my trip.</p>

                  The Lake Sebu Dream Weavers
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>While certain <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> are widely used throughout the Philippines some are unique to certain ethnic groups. Traditional costumes and textiles are notable in particular.
            Dream Weavers are women from T'boli living in the southern part of the archipelago close to Lake Sebu in the province of South Cotabato. They weave T'nalak which is hand-woven cloth made from fibers from the indigenous plant Abaca. The fabric, and the women who make it, are adored. It is surprising to learn that the designs they weave weren't invented by women or their grandparents. Fu Dalu, the spirit of the Abaca was the one who brought the designs to them in visions, and they were reconstructed completely from memories.</p>
            <h2>Indonesian Arts and Crafts</h2>
            <p>Beadwork, jewelry, batik pottery, metal wooden carving stone carving, leather puppets and painting are just some types from Indonesian <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> and art. If you're looking through the market stalls or hunting for the perfect present take note that these works were made with local artisans who utilized their skills and talents to make these pieces. Every leather puppet or wood carving every beautiful batik is an original work of art that pays tribute to the rich history of Indonesia.</p>

                <h3>
                  Carvings in Wood
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The shop that we visited had small and big pieces. Decorations of gods like Buddha or Ganesh and masks were among the little items. Tableaux, walls and columns feature <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> made of carvings on the doors and walls.
            The remains of the deceased or other religious offerings are kept in wooden urns or other beautiful receivers. The bigger pieces were real furniture, that we saw in restaurants and homes of the local area and also an indication of how carving on wood is important to everyone in the Balinese. A bigger piece as per the owner of the workshop, can take between four and six months to finish and show true passion for art.
            Ebony, crocodile trees (found exclusively in Bali) and hibiscus sandalwood (from Flores Island), and mahogany are the most important elements of wood. The skills of sculptors are amazing using metal tools, their sharp carving tools that carefully remove wood chips, and then transforming the rough log of wood into a work of art.
            These villages, Tegalalang, Singakerta, Pujung, Jati, Pengosekan, Celuk and Mas are the home of many of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> made by Indonesia's carvers. Kubu Taman Sari, Batusepih, Kemenuh - Sukawati was the place we visited.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>
                  Puppets made from leather
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>The small store, hidden off to the side of the road, was hiding the extraordinary work that was done. In the case of leather, there's only stitching. The first worker started by cutting the leather skin employing pinching tools to make the design and pattern of the figurine. Buffalo skin is considered to be the most suitable skin to make these <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> of leather-based puppets and cow skin can also be employed often.
            A small item may require only a couple of days of careful work, while a bigger doll might take weeks. Most of the puppets range from 10 to thirty inches (25 and 75 centimeters) in height. The artist who painted them painted other parts with the natural yellow skin color to create a backdrop or coloring it black or white in accordance with the personality of the figure in <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a>. Every single area on the model is then painted and can take weeks to finish because each layer must be dried before proceeding to the next. The apparatus which creates puppets is constructed of natural materials like soft wood and plant material. In Bali the art of puppetry is called Wayang kulit which means "shadow puppetry." It is believed to be one of the oldest known puppet form dating up to either the 9th or 8th centuries.</p>

                <h3>
                  Batik
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The workshop we attended was excellent and very informative. Two different batik techniques were demonstrated in a tiny space. The hot wax can be utilized to create <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> lines and dots. Another option is to make use of an iron stamp that is hot for printing the pattern. Printing batiks are typically more affordable because they are manufactured quicker.
            The heavier stamps were typically used by men who would dip them in wax and then pressed them into the fabric to make them impregnate the fabric. Drawing with a pencil became the sole activity of women who carefully drawn lines and dots to large swaths of white or colored fabrics.
            While they dipped their brushes in hot wax prior to drawing, the free flow of their fingers was as if they were dancing. The women made a circle around boiling pots, waiting to be dipped in. A long line of clothing were drying in the shade following the workshop had contaminated sheets of white with natural colors. In particular, Balinese are a local community. Balinese are influenced by and wear <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that aren't just to be used by tourists. The position of the bearer, particular locations, or traditional occasions like weddings could be all revealed by designs. We visited Batik Plentong on Jl. Tirtodipuran 48 in Yogyakarta.</p>

              </li>
            </ul>	
            <p>Even though we didn't visit the stone carving workshop the beauty of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> wall carvings we saw in various temples was not to be missed. The design of the junction showed the highest quality of workmanship, with scenes that were a reflection of mythology and history which were extremely precise and precise.
            Stone narrative can be seen in temples, such as those of Hindu Pura Besakih. Local artisans are working to repair the damaged artifacts, their skills and knowledge is evident in a variety of places, such as Prambanan Temple.
