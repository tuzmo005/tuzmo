            </ul>	
           <p> Prior to the early 1700s we mainly drank and ate from wooden plates and bowls and plates, except for the temporary switch to pottery due to the Romans. Each town was home to a wood-turner, who employed an elastic sapling that was fastened on the base for his pole lathe which was a <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> piece of wood posts and beams. A cord is hung from the sapling's free end when it is tied to a chuck that has a spike, which is that is hammered into the block of wood that you're turning. The chuck rotates when you press it down on the treadle of a foot that is attached to the cord's opposite. When you release your treadle, it turns back around. A chisel or hook makes the wood stronger with every downward stroke. It's a skillful job which is also very satisfying.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> In the 1950s, baskets made of willow were used to transport laundry, vegetables as well as coal, fruit bikes, shopping and even mail were the norm in British life. The weaving of baskets hasn't changed much over the course of thousands of years. Knives are employed to lift the ends of rods of willow and to trim the basket's finished form; a bodkin is used to create holes in the weaving. The cleave and shave are utilized to cut rods into four or three smaller skeins; and beaters are used to knock the weave down. The base is initially constructed by constructing a round or rectangular frame that is made up of larger stakes, interspersed with finer rods of willow. The stakes that are upright from <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> are then inserted to create the side frame, after which weaving begins. The stakes for the upright are then put in to build the side frame. The initial weave will be laid. Then, you weave using one of the many types, such as rending, fetching, slewing, and weaving. Then you finish with a top-to bottom border. A strong hand, and sense of straight lines and lots of patience are needed.</p>

                        Walling made of dry stone
                    </h4>
                </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The United Kingdom has 125,000 miles dry stone walls throughout the United Kingdom. A few of them are very old, dating back to the year 3,500 BC. The majority of them are fields walls built during the mid- to late 1800s as a result of the Enclosure Acts. They were maintained well for over the past century, but farming is now unable to afford the necessary resources. Dry stone walls are making an appearance in the last few years. It's akin to making the components of a 3D Jigsaw puzzle to make <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a>. The stones that make up the base that are massive weighty, get placed in a trench that is shallow, then followed by huge flat stones, and then caps that are straight. The only tool you need is a hammer, with sharp edges. However, skilled Wallers avoid cutting stone into shapes the most perfect shape.
