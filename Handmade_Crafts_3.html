            </ul>	
            <p> In the beginning of the 1700s, the majority of us ate and drank using wooden bowls and plates and plates, except for the temporary switch to pottery due to the Romans. Each town had a local wood turner who utilized an elastic sapling that was fastened on the base of his pole lathe which was a <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> piece of wood posts and beams. A cord is hung from the sapling's free end when it is tied to a chuck that has a spike, which is which is then hammered into the block wood that you're turning. The chuck spins when you press down an ankle treadle that's attached to the cord's other end. When you release the treadle the block rotates back around. A chisel or hook creates the wood using every downward stroke. It's a skillful job and extremely satisfying.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>	
            <p> In the 1950s, wet baskets were used to transport laundry, vegetables as well as coal, fruit bikes, shopping and even mail were an integral part of British life. The weaving of baskets hasn't changed much over the course of thousands of years. Knives are employed to lift the ends of rods of willow and to trim the finished basket. A bodkin is used to create holes in the weaving. A cleave or shave is used to cut rods into four or three smaller skeins; and beating irons are employed to knock the weave down. The base is initially constructed by constructing a round or rectangular frame that is made up of larger stakes, interspersed with finer rods of willow. The stakes that are upright from <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> are then added to create the side frame. Then it is then laid the initial weave. The stakes for the upright are then added to the side frame, and then the initial weave will be laid. You then begin weaving using one of the many types, such as rending, fetching, slewing and weaving. Then you finish with a top-to bottom border. Good hands, a sharp ability to see straight lines and lots of patience are needed.</p>

            </ul>	
            <p> It is estimated that there are 15,000 miles of dry stone walls throughout the United Kingdom. Some of them are very ancient, dating back to the year 3,500 BC. The majority of them are field walls that were built in the mid- to late 1800s as a result of the Enclosure Acts. They were maintained well for over the past century, but farming is now unable to afford the necessary resources. Dry stone walls are seeing an appearance again. It's like putting together a 3D Jigsaw puzzle to make <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a>. The stones that make up the base that are massive weighty, get placed in a trench that is shallow, then followed by huge flat stones and finally, caps that are straight. The only tool you need is a hammer that has sharp edges, however skilled Wallers avoid cutting the stones into shapes as much as is possible.
