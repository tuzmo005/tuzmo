            The cutting of stone was tough and time-consuming process. Granite, for instance, was often used by carvers. They would pound out the initial design of the object using dolerite, a kind of rock. The next step was to use stones and copper chisels for polishing the design and add details. They employed quartz sand in order for smoothing and polishing the work. Color was usually applied to the final piece by artists.</p>

They use these talents to make products that are authentic and culturally based. Crafts can be taught in the either at home or in a classroom in a classroom. Crafts aren't designed to convey items that have significant symbolic or traditional significance or to conform to a particular ideology, to demonstrate a sense of identity or to safeguard the heritage of a community.</p>
            <h3>What techniques are used by artists to learn their craft?</h3>
           <p> Artists acquire knowledge from their families and their communities. They learn and pass techniques, skills and techniques through generations, starting when they are young. The <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> are a part of the community.

           <p> There was no shops or factories close by, <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> were able to craft manufactured items they required for their daily life in their communities.

Here are a few examples of the specialized techniques used:</p>
            <h3>Artists from different nations:</h3>
           <h5> Here are a few <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> who present all over the world.</h5>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   <h4>
                    Murano, Italy - Glass Blowers
                   </h4>
               </li>
           </ul> 
           <p> Murano which is a small island to the north of Venice is among the most beautiful locations in the world to witness glass blowing in motion. The island's distinct manufacturing process hasn't changed much since its beginnings around the 8th century (the art form was first discovered within its earliest days in Middle East circa 300 BC) however, it's an active business. Glass that is molten dragged out of the furnace using an unfinished steel tube, and then rolled out to form an iron surface called marver. Warm air is blown in the pipe, which causes the glass to expand, and is then moved until the desired shape is reached.

           </ul>

The sheaths, comprised of animal hides, wood, and horn are not just a way to ensure the <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> from harm but also protect the creators of work however, they also permit them to show it in its full glory.</p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   <h4>
                    Fes, Morocco: Leather Tanners
                   </h4>

The skins are treated first then stained using natural colors like the saffron color, henna color and cedar wood prior to being thrown over the roofs for drying under the scorching North African sun.</p>
            <h3>The Challenges Facing Artists in developing countries</h3>
           <p> Small-scale and cottage industries play an important part to play in generating revenues and creating jobs. They serve as a means of the reduction of poverty. Handicrafts can help keep the traditions of aesthetics and culture in good health and alive. However, this industry faces significant challenges. Craftsmen find it extremely difficult to pay the bills. Some of them have been forced to quit their professions." It is essential to develop an ongoing program that will help these <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> with their skills and to preserve the cultural and national heritage they represent.
            There are many underlying causes that have led to the decline of handicrafts within emerging nations. In rural areas, poor infrastructure hinders handicraft businesses. There isn't enough power and it is difficult to finish products in time. Equipment is damaged by frequent power interruptions and voltage fluctuations. Since roads are often not developed and paved, craftsmen face a tough finding and transporting the raw material, and this can increase the cost of production.
            Artists are often not able to have access to appropriate markets. They aren't able to access or connections to the raw material suppliers as they typically deal with middlemen. This places them in a disadvantage as they need to be knowledgeable of a variety of suppliers in order to negotiate the most favorable cost and quality. They have a lack of options for exports and marketing connections. They are not able to access international markets and depend on local outings or shows, which are scarce.
            <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> are slaves to middlemen in an endless cycle of exploitation. They rely on middlemen in order to sell their products since they aren't able to access to the markets. However, they do pay them relatively little and pay them according to the amount of items they create. Middlemen make a lot of money by selling their products at a price that is exorbitant. They take nearly all the proceeds generated by these transactions, though they do not get all of it. In addition, when customers contact middlemen, craftsmen are out of the equation. They're not able to build an engaged customer base, and aren't sure how to reach and keep them. It is difficult for them to go out by themselves due to this.
            In the majority of poor countries there's a shortage of accurate statistics on those who run the <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> in the business. Since it's a component in the economy that is not formal, there's not any data readily available. This makes it hard for legislators to come up with effective ways to protect artisans. In the end, the process of promoting and revitalizing this sector is becoming more difficult. Furthermore younger generations are reluctant to follow the path of their parents and forefathers. They prefer to work in factories where the work is not as hard and the wages are better.
