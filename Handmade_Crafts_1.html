                    <h4>
                        Blacksmithing
                    </h4>
                </li>
            </ul>	
            <p> Blacksmiths shape and join iron and steel using fire, hammers, and an anvil to create everything from gates and stairs to chairs, fire irons, curtain poles, doorknobs, jeweler, and sculptures. A tiny forge to heat the metal to 1,000°C (1832°F), an anvil with various cutting and bending tools that fit neatly into it to create a strong <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a>, pliers, a vice, and a variety of hammers and punches are all required. The talents must be learned and can take years to master, but they are well worth the effort. Cut-and-weld manufacturing produces metals with a distinct character, whereas smiting produces metalwork with a distinct character.</p>
            <ul>

                    <h4>
                        Turning a pole lathe
                    </h4>
                </li>
            </ul>	
            <p> Until the early 1700s, we mostly ate and drank from hardwood plates and bowls, with the exception of a temporary conversion to pottery owing to the Romans. Every town had its own wood turner, who used a springy sapling fastened at the base to drive his pole lathe, which was a <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> assembly of timber beams and posts. A length of cord hangs from the sapling's free end, once tied around a spiked chuck pounded into the block of wood you're turning. The chuck turns when you press down on a foot treadle linked to the cord's opposite end. When you let off of the treadle, the block revolves back around. A chisel or hook tool forms the wood with each downward stroke. It's a highly skilled job that's also extremely gratifying.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Basket making
                    </h4>
                </li>
            </ul>	
            <p> Until the 1950s, willow baskets – for carrying vegetables, laundry, coal, fruit, bicycles, shopping, and mail – were a staple of British life. Basket weaving hasn't altered much in thousands of years. Knives are used to tip the ends of the willow rods and trim the finished basket; a bodkin is used to form gaps in the weave; a cleave and shave is used to break rods into three or four finer skeins; and a beating iron is used to hammer the weave down. The base is constructed initially, consisting of a round or rectangular frame formed of stronger stakes intertwined with finer willow rods. The upright stakes of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a> are next inserted to construct the side frame, and the first weave is laid. The upright stakes are next inserted to construct the side frame, and the first weave is laid. Then you begin weaving in one of several styles, including rending, slewing, fetching, and waling. Finish with a top-to-bottom border. Strong hands, an excellent eye for straight lines, and a lot of patience are required.</p>
            <ul>

                    <h4>
                        Dry stone walling
                    </h4>
                </li>
            </ul>	
            <p> There are 125,000 miles of dry stone walls in the United Kingdom. A handful of them are really old, going back to 3,500 BC. The majority are field walls constructed in the early to mid-1800s in response to the Enclosure Acts. They were well-maintained for a century, but farming now lacks the resources. Dry stone walling is making a resurgence these days. It's similar to putting together a 3D jigsaw puzzle for <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">Handmade crafts</a>. The base stones, which are enormous and heavy, are laid in a shallow trench, followed by large, flat stones, and lastly erect cap stones. Your sole instrument is a hammer with a sharp edge, but good Wallers try to avoid cutting stones to form as much as possible.
