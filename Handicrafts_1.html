                        It stimulates creativity and the imagination
                    </h4>
                </li>

                    </h4>
                </li>
            </ul>

             Kids examine guidelines of behavior without realizing it: Waiting for his or her turn to speak, soliciting for assist while wished, expressing their ideasâ€¦ While teens and adults discover ways to shape a team and collaborate in the direction of a not unusual goal. While on the equal time growing empathy and camaraderie.</p>
            <ul>

                    <h4>
                        It reduces stress and anxiety
                    </h4>
