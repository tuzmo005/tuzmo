            <h2>Philippines Traditional Arts and Crafts</h2>
           <p> The Philippines The arts and crafts of the Philippines have been around for many thousands of years jade carving is one of the earliest examples that dates back to around 2200 BC. While many of the indigenous <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> like pottery and weaving, remain alive and well other crafts, such as the wood carving of a religious nature that I observed in Pampanga are newcomers brought by people of other provinces.
            The Philippines numerous art as well as <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> are not just to its unique melting pot of cultures, as well as the wealth of natural materials readily accessible, including bamboo, rattan, or coconut shells, just to name just a few.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>
                  This is an Oyster that comes with the Windowpane

              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The craft industry is also benefiting from the abundance of the ocean. Capiz for instance, is originated by the shells of Placuna placenta mollusk which is abundant in Philippine waters. Mollusks that are edible are taken to eat and the shells are utilized for <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> for fishermen. There is no waste!
            Capiz is delicate transparent and iridescent in nature. Spanish people living in the Philippines utilized capiz shells to create <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that included stained windows made of glass for their churches during the 16th century. It earned the mollusk the title "windowpane oyster." Capiz lampshades made of shells hanging from trees in gardens and parks are becoming more commonplace. I couldn't resist purchasing one in the airport prior to getting on my return flight to use it as an ornament to decorate my tree for Christmas. It's a wonderful way to remember my trip.</p>

                  The Lake Sebu Dream Weavers
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> While certain <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> are common throughout the Philippines some are unique to particular ethnic groups. The traditional costumes and the textiles are notable in particular.
            Dream Weavers are women from T'boli who reside in the southern part of the archipelago, near Lake Sebu in the province of South Cotabato. They weave T'nalak which is hand-woven cloth made from yarns made from indigenous plant Abaca. The fabric, and the women who make it, are adored. It is surprising to learn that the designs they weave weren't invented by women or their predecessors. Fu Dalu, the spirit of the Abaca was the one who brought the designs to them through their visions, and they were reconstructed completely by memory.
            Indonesian Arts and Crafts
            Batik, jewelry, beads pottery, metal baskets, carving wood stone carving, leather puppets and painting are just some of the types from Indonesian <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> and art. If you're browsing through market stalls or hunting for that perfect item be aware that these items were designed from local craftsmen who utilized their skills and talents to make these pieces. Every leather puppet or any carving on wood or any gorgeous batik is a work art that pays tribute to the rich history of Indonesia.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>
                  Carvings in Wood
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The small shop we visited had small and huge pieces. Decorations of gods like Buddha or Ganesh and masks were among the little items. Tableaux, walls and columns feature <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> made of carvings that decorate the doors and walls.
            The remains of bodies that have been cremated or other religious offerings are kept in wooden urns or other exquisite receivers. The largest pieces were authentic furniture, some of which were found in restaurants and local homes as well as an indication that carving on wood is important to everyone in the Balinese. A bigger piece as per the owner of the workshop, can take anywhere from four to six months to make and show true passion for art.
            Ebony, crocodile trees (found just in Bali) as well as hibiscus, sandalwood (from Flores Island), and mahogany are all the essentials of wood. The abilities of the sculptors are amazing in the way they employ metal tools, their sharp carving tools that carefully remove wood chips, and then transforming an unfinished log of wood into a work of art.
            These villages, Tegalalang, Singakerta, Pujung, Jati, Pengosekan, Celuk and Mas are the home of many of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> made by Indonesia's carvers. Kubu Taman Sari from Batusepih, Kemenuh - Sukawati was the place we visited.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>
                  Puppets made from leather
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The tiny shop, hidden behind the road, was hiding the extraordinary work which had been completed. Leather is only stitching. One person began by carving the leather skin employing pinching tools to make the design and pattern of the figurine. Buffalo skin is considered to be the ideal skin to make these <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> with leather as well as cow skins are employed at times.
            A tiny object could require only a couple of days of careful work, while a bigger doll might take weeks. Most of the puppets range from 10 to thirty inches (25 and 75 centimeters) in height. The artist who painted them painted other parts with the natural yellow skin color to create a backdrop or painting it black or white according to the type of the puppet as in <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a>. Every single area on the model is then painted and requires weeks of work because each layer must be dried before moving onto the next. The equipment that creates the puppets is comprised of natural materials like soft wood and even plants. In Bali the art form is called Wayang kulit that is a reference to "shadow puppetry." It is believed to be one of the oldest known puppet form dating in the late 8th, or the 9th.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>
                  Batik
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> The workshop we attended was excellent and very informative. Two different batik techniques were demonstrated in a tiny space. The hot wax is utilized to create <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> lines and dots. Another option is to make use of an iron stamp that is hot for printing the pattern. Printing batiks are typically more affordable because they are manufactured more quickly.
            The heavier stamps were typically used by men who would dip them in wax and then pressed them into the fabric in order to imprint them on the fabric. Drawing with a pencil became the sole activity of women who carefully drawn lines and dots to large swaths of white or colored fabrics.
            When they immersed the brush in hot wax prior to drawing, the free flow of their fingers was as if they were dancing. The women made a circle around containers of wax, waiting to be dipped in. A line of clothes were drying in shade after the workshop had contaminated it with natural colors. In particular, Balinese are a local community. Balinese are influenced by and wear <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> that are not only to be used by tourists. The position of the bearer, particular locations, or traditional occasions like weddings could be identified through designs. We visited Batik Plentong on Jl. Tirtodipuran 48 in Yogyakarta.</p>

                <h3>
                  Stone Carving
                </h3>
              </li>
            </ul>	
           <p> Although we didn't visit an art workshop for stone carving the beauty of <a href="https://tuzmo.com/">traditional crafts</a> of carving walls that we saw at temples was not to be missed. The designs for the junctions showed an impressive degree of craftsmanship, featuring scenes that reflected mythology and history which were extremely precise and precise.
            Stone narrative can be seen in temples, such as those of Hindu Pura Besakih. Local artisans are fixing damaged artifacts, their skills and knowledge are evident in many locations, including Prambanan Temple.
