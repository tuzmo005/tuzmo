            <h3>Problems Presented by Artists in developing countries</h3>
           <p> Small-scale and cottage industries play an important part to play in generating income and jobs. They serve as a means of the reduction of poverty. Handicrafts are a way to keep the traditions of aesthetics and culture intact and in good condition. However, this industry has encountered significant difficulties. Craftsmen find it extremely difficult to pay the bills. Some of them have begun to quit their jobs." It is crucial to establish an ongoing program that will help these <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> to stay in the field and to safeguard the heritage of the nation and culture which these crafts are a part of.
            There are many underlying causes which have contributed to the decline in handicrafts in emerging nations. In rural areas, poor infrastructure can hinder handicraft businesses. There isn't enough power and it is difficult to finish products in time. Equipment is damaged by frequent power outages and changes in voltage. Since roads are often not developed crafters have a hard getting and transferring the raw material, and this can increase costs for production.
            Artists are often not able to have access to the right markets. They do not have access or access to suppliers of raw materials since they are mostly middlemen. This makes them vulnerable since they must be knowledgeable of a variety of suppliers in order to negotiate the most favorable cost and quality. The artists they represent have limited options for exports and marketing connections. They are not able to access international markets and rely on local events or shows, which are scarce.
            <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> are being enslaved by middlemen within an endless cycle of abuse. They rely on middlemen in order to sell their products since they aren't able to access to the markets. However, they do pay them relatively little and pay them according to the amount of pieces they create. Middlemen make a lot of money by selling their products at a price that is exorbitant. They take nearly all the proceeds made from sales but they are not the only ones. Furthermore, when clients reach out to middlemen, craftsmen remain out of the equation. They're unable to create an engaged customer base, and don't know how to reach and keep them. It's hard for them to go out by themselves due to this.
            In the majority of poor countries there is a dearth of accurate statistics on those who run the <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a> of the business. Since its part in the economy that is not formal, there's not any data readily available. This makes it challenging for legislators to create effective ways to protect <a href=“https://www.tuzmo.com/”>artisans</a>s. This means that encouraging and revitalizing the craft industry is becoming more difficult. Furthermore the new generation is not keen on following the path of their mothers and fathers. They prefer to work in factories where the work is easier and the wages are better.
